synopsis: "bindings to the OpenAI API"
description: """
Autogenerated from the OpenAI openapi spec, I've also tweaked and enhanced the generated bindings by hand,
and will continue to do so.

Much credit belongs to Github user cgensoul, who wrote the OCaml generator for OpenAPI. I only had to make a few small changes to get it to work.
